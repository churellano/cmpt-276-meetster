1. Meetster

Meetster is a web application that allows users to create certain events and share them in public. The events can be local meetings or online seminars where the description of the event such as the place, time, and people who confirmed are created as a subject. Users must sign up or log in to create events. Users can choose the location where the particular event is occurring, the date, time, and the size of the event. Users can add other users as friends and can also form groups which could well be transformed into a mini community. The events can be one time or recurring. The creator of an event gets an admin status for that event and can choose to embed a video about the event they are organizing. Everyone that signs up for an event gets automatically added to that events chat room. Overall, this web-application creates a mini-community where people are able to socialize through the use of events as well as making a friendly environment where people could chat. This makes it easier for people to keep track of new events especially for those who are outgoing.
