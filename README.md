### Simple online game with leaderboard [ClipMini.io]  
ClipMini is a collection of mini browser based single player games.The front page contains various games that the user can choose from and each game contains a specific icon designated to make it easier to recognize. The games are simple input and output based games where the players compete against other to get a higher score. The game displays a leaderboard which the player can try to reach and can engage in weekly challenges which provide them with achievements. In addition, users are required to register so that their records are retained and can make friends lists at which they could send messages. This application allows players to have multiple games stored in a web page that can be easily be accessed.

* What is the name of your web application?  
**ClipMini.io**

* Do we have a clear understanding of the problem?  
**We want to play games and be competitive.**

* How is this problem solved currently (if at all)?  
  **Our game is small enough, it does not take too long time for each round. So when people playing other games and they are waiting in the lobby, they can start to play this game instead of just waiting at there. And for those people who do not have time to play large online games, they can play our game instead.**

* How will this project make life easier?  
**You will receive a healthy dose of dopamine and you will smile.**

* Who is the target audience?  
**Casual gamers.**

* Who will use your product?  
**Anyone that wants to play games.**

* Does this project have many individual features, or one main feature (possibility with many subproblems)? These are the ‘epics’ of your project.  
  **Leaderboard, Mini Games, and Unique login system**

* What are some sample stories/scenarios?  
  **Tom had a long day, he wants to play a simple game of snakes so he hops on to the website and plays. Tom is slightly competitive so he looks at the leaderboards to see where he places. He score is nowhere near the top so he decides to play for one hour. Tom has successfully reached 5th place and is now satisfied.**

* Be honest, is the amount of work required in this proposal enough for five group members?  
**Yes, implementing the interface and the various games will pose a significant challenge.**


### Discussion Board with comment postings and live chat [AllChat]  
AllChat is web-application that contains different threads, collaborative topics, and real-time live interaction. People will be able to share stories and information with those that have similar interests as well as chat with them in real time. In terms of the functionality, people within the discussion boards can have upvotes or downvotes on the comments and this would enable the comment with the most votes to be put on the very top of the thread so that it is easily visible by the users. In addition, topics itself are represented by an icon with a short description or title beneath it. A more appealing, interactive, and user-friendly interface will make the users navigate through the pages easier. This would allow users to have a mini-community where they share their opinions, ideas and at the same time have a collaborative experience.  

* Do we have a clear understanding of the problem?
**People wish to share stories with others and see others opinions.**

* How is this problem solved currently (if at all)?  
**There are a few websites such as Reddit and 4chan that are variations of discussion boards. But Allchat has added extra features with more user-friendly interface.**

* How will this project make life easier?  
**People will be able to share stories and information with those that have similar interests as well as chat with them in real time. Moreover, a more appealing, interactive, and user-friendly interface will make the users navigate through the pages easier.** 

* Who is the target audience?  
**Everyone, but mainly people from ages 13 and above.**

* Who will use your product?  
**People who want to interact with those with similar interests.**

* Does this project have many individual features, or one main feature (possibility with many subproblems)? These are the ‘epics’ of your project.  
**Live video chat and an icon based UI that makes it easier for the users to navigate through different topics. Topics itself are represented by an icon with a short description or title beneath it. Users can have reputation based on the amount of votes their comments.**

* What are some sample stories/scenarios?  
**Timmy’s cancer finally disappeared so he wants to share his journey of recovery with the world. He uploads multiple pictures and text to the website. Online strangers see his post and congratulate him. One person in particular wants to congratulate him personally so he hops into the livechat and has a conversation with Timmy himself.**

* Be honest, is the amount of work required in this proposal enough for five group members?  
**Yes, the login system, the subgenre menu, the discussion tree, the live chat are features that are tasks that need to be implemented.**

### University Dating Website [DateUpUni]    
DateUpUNI is a web app to make online dating easier for university students. Through the use of student verification, it guarantees that users will be able to find potential “matches” that fall within approximately the same age range as themselves. Additionally, it will decrease the amount of fake bot accounts present on the service compared to apps like Tinder.
